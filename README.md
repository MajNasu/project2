>Tired of seeing superior LinkedIn profiles?

>Would you like to sabotage other profiles to feel better about yourself?

>craftli lets users register to its cutting-edge technologies. Upon registry, the user is added to the list of established users.

Any user can create a mock profile, providing a brand statement and a summary, also letting any user edit/delete the aforementioned profile.

### Technologies
MEAN stack, Heroku, Git

### Bugs
Users can't delete other users *yet*.

### Improvements to be made:
1. Styling for multiple media devices.
2. Proper padding/spacing around elements.
3. Comments/Feedback on profiles.
4. Users own the profiles they create. (But can still be deleted/edited by others)
5. Picture capability.
6. More content.
7. Enlarge text areas for About and Summary.
